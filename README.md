# CSS tunnel effect

The original idea was to create an app that demonstrates the usage of dark patterns in UI. I wanted to create a fancy tunnel effect menu where you could click the glowing balls to get to dark pattern views. I ended up just focusing on CSS animation.

The application is available at:
